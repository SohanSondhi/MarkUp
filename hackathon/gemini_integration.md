Markup is an agentic Slack workflow that turns plain-English UI requests into safe frontend merge requests and verified previews. The GitLab Duo agent is central in two phases. First, a planning call scans the repo file list and a small set of relevant file contents to produce a structured plan: target files, target URL path, risks, and open questions. This keeps latency low while still using strong reasoning to de-risk edits and request clarifications when needed. Second, a patch call generates full-file edits using a strict JSON schema. Guardrails enforce frontend-only paths and block new files, ensuring safe, reviewable diffs that can be opened as a clean MR. These Duo agent features -- fast planning and high-fidelity patch generation -- define the application's workflow and make the Slack-to-MR experience trustworthy for non-technical users. Structured JSON responses act as a contract at each stage, enabling deterministic orchestration and auditability. A multimodal visual QA step with Duo Vision is planned for a later iteration.
